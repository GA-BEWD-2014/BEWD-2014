##Sharing Behavior
###Sharing is Caring

*	Inheritance
*	Mixins'
*	Modules

---



##Inheritance
###"I got is from my momma" - Will.i.am

*	Share properties & behavior
*	Keeps code DRY

##Inheritance
###Glimpse into Rails

*	Where you'll see it…

		class User < ActiveRecord::Base
		end


---



##Inheritance
###Recap

*	One class can inherit the capabilities of another using the ```<``` operator.
*	Sub-class inherits from super-class (child class inherits from parent class)
*	A child can override a parent variable or method by re-using its nameclass. 

*	If defined in different physical files, a child must require its parent

##Sharing Behavior
###Getting Ready For Rails

*	The following slides introduce other ways to share behavior. 
*	This is an introduction and we will see more when we start Rails. 
*	For now lets understand the basics. 


---


##Sharing Behavior
###Mixins



---

##Mixins
###When inheritance doesn't work.

*	What if our classes don't have an "is a" relationship.



---

##Mixins
###Teddit as an example

*	Lets say teddit now accepts photos, videos and stories. 


![Why use mixins](../../assets/ruby/redundant_methods.png)

*	You can up and down vote all of them.


---


##Mixins
	module Upvotable
		def upvote!
    		@upvote += 1
    	end
    	
    	def downvote!
    		@upvote -= 1
    	end
	end

	
	class Photo
		attr_reader :photographer, :resolution, :upvotes
		include Upvotable
		
		def initialize(photographer, resolution)
    		@photographer = photographer
    		@resolution = resolution
    		@upvotes = 1
    	end
	end

	class Story
		attr_reader :title, :author, :upvotes
		include Upvotable
		
		def initialize(title, author)
    		@title = title
    		@author = author
    		@upvotes = 1
    	end
    end

##Sharing Behavior
###Include vs Require

*	What's the difference?

---


##Sharing Behavior
###Modules

*	What if we wanted to have two bat classes. 

		class Bat
			def fly!
				puts "So free.. and blind"
			end
		end

		# Somewhere else in your code
		class Bat
			def made_of
				"wood"
    		end
		end

		slugger = Bat.new
		slugger.fly?!??!

---


##Modules
###Namespace It


	module Animal
		class Bat
			def fly!
				puts "So free.. and blind"
    		end
    	end
	end

	Animal::Bat.new

	module BaseballUtensils
		class Bat
    		def made_of
      			"wood"
    		end
    	end
	end

	BaseballUtensils::Bat.new

##Modules
###Namespace It

*	You're set and ready to start rails.

## Homework

## Resources: Sharing Behavior

Good code should be reused!

###Cheat Sheet

####load vs. require vs. include

Why do they all sound the same??!!!!

*	load: inserts a file's contents
	*	File can be loaded more than once.

		```load 'config.rb'```

*	require inserts parsed contents: We use it to require a class in another .rb file.
	*	File is only required once.

		```require 'config'```

*	include 'mixes in' modules. Use to include modules and mixins.
		
		```include 'my_module'``` 

####Inheritance
*	One class can inherit the capabilities of another using ```<``` *	Sub-class inherits from super-class (child class inherits from parent class)

*	If defined in different physical files, a child must require its parent-- lib/person.rb ---```ruby
	class Person	end

```--- lib/worker.rb ---```ruby
		require 'lib/person'	class Worker < Person	end
```
Heres a lengthy example: 

*	Don't repeat yourself (DRY)*	Don't do this!

```ruby
	class ScienceSubteddit
  		@@name = "Science"
  		@@description = "Where we blow stuff up for fun"
  		def self.welcome
    		puts "Welcome to the #{@@name} Subteddit!"
    		puts @@description
  		end
	end

	class MoviesSubteddit
  		@@name = "Movies"
  		@@description = "Because the Matrix was awesome"
  		def self.welcome
    		puts "Welcome to the #{@@name} Subteddit!"
    		puts @@description
  		end
	end

	class SportsSubteddit
  		@@name = "Sports"
  		@@description = "We have big muscles and we run fast"
  		def self.welcome
    		puts "Welcome to the #{@@name} Subteddit!"
    		puts @@description
  		end
	end

	class RubySubteddit
  		@@name = "Ruby"
  		@@description = "Because Python Sucks"
  		def self.welcome
    		puts "Welcome to the #{@@name} Subteddit!"
    		puts @@description
  		end
	end
```


*	This is a better approach and demonstrates the benefit of using Object Oriented programming. 
	*	News sections inherit from Subteddit.


```ruby
	class Subteddit
  		@@name = ""
  		@@description = ""
  		def self.welcome
    		puts "Welcome to the #{@@name} Subteddit!"
    		puts @@description
  		end
	end

	class ScienceSubteddit < Subteddit
  		@@name = "Science"
  		@@description = "Where we blow stuff up for fun"
	end

	class MoviesSubteddit < Subteddit
  		@@name = "Movies"
  		@@description = "Because the Matrix was awesome"
	end

	class SportsSubteddit < Subteddit
  		@@name = "Sports"
  		@@description = "We have big muscles and we run fast"
	end

	class RubySubteddit < Subteddit
  		@@name = "Ruby"
  		@@description = "Because Python Sucks"
	end
```

####Mixins

*	Include a module in a class to access the module's methods. This also keeps code DRY.```ruby
	module MyModule  		def module_method(parameters)    		return parameter  		end	end
```

```ruby
	class MyClass
		include MyModule	end	my_object = MyClass.new
	my_object.module_method```
####Modules

Ruby exposes much core functionality through modulesA commonly used built in module is MathThe :: operator is used to refer to a constant set in a module```ruby
	puts Math.sqrt(9)
```
>3.0```ruby
	puts Math::PI
```
>3.1415926


*	A module is like a class, except 
	*	You cannot create a new instance of a module	*	You cannot extend a module to create a child module*	Modules are a way to add namespaces

Ruby docs have a full list of available modules.


###Still Feel Lost? 

Its ok, we will see these terms again in Rails, but you can also,
