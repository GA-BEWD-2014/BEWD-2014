MATERIALS
--------
Lesson folders 1 through 19 include: 

*	Additional Exercises
*	Code Alongs
*	Exercises
*	Homework
*	Skeleton Deck
*	Lesson Guide (Readme.md)

We will provide a __private repository__ for your course. This is how you will share ICL files and slides with students. 
Students will fork your repository and use the fork as their class repo.


SLIDES
-----

We are using reveal.js with markdown 
See [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) for further documentation.

The slides are a skeletal deck and require your input! If there are slides you do not agree with then update them. If you want to introduce topics in a different order, then reorder them. We ask that you keep the CSS styling the same.

	
PREPARING FOR CLASS
--------

1.	__Customize the deck before sharing with the class.__
2.	Decide how you will bring your expertise to the classroom.
3.	Review exercises, code alongs and homework.
4.	If not using the GA suggested in class labs, look through additional exercises folder and choose one. Still not satisfied, create your own and make sure it hits the same topics and learning objectives for that lesson.
5.	Post your personalized materials to your course repo.
6.	Made an excellent change? Make note and let us know during one of our checkins'.
