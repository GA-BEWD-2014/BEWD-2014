##GETTING STARTED WITH CURRICULUM

Welcome to the BEWD Curriculum v. 1.0.1. 

This repository contains all the materials GA supplies its Back-End Web Development instructors. 

General Assembly's Back-End Web Development (BEWD) course is made up of 20 lessons that are 3 hours each. The first 6 classes cover Ruby Basics and the following 14 cover Ruby on Rails. We __highly recommend__ you begin preparing your lessons before the course starts. You should start prepping to teach the materials 4 weeks prior to course launch. 

During these preparation weeks you should: 

Review all curriculum materials and think about how you would like to apply your teaching style to the classroom. Begin to update slides for each lesson.


##AVAILABLE MATERIALS

We've supplied a folder for each lesson. In these folders we've included:

|Materials | Description | How to Use It|
|----|---------|---------------|
| __Lesson Agenda__ / __README.md__| Topic break down and suggested schedule. | Use this to get a high level view of the course.|
| __Slides__| Markdown file with slide content.| Customized the deck before sharing with students in GitHub. Use [reveal.js]() to present to the class . Keep the same folder structure so that image relative paths still work.|
| __Code Demo__| Code to be used by instructors to help demonstrate a concept.|Type slowly and explain the concepts while students follow along with code and type their notes. Every code demo has a matching instructor file for you.|
| __instr_code_demo_notes.md__| Notes from the curriculum team about how to use a particular code demo.| As we gain feedback from instructors and students, we've become aware of student pain points for students. This document is notes to help you deliver the best course.|
| __Exercises__|Code examples to be completed without instructor guidance.| You should read the instructions and solution files. You must be able to further explain content to students.|
| __instr_exercise_notes.md__| Notes about how to conduct in class exercises.|Similar to the code demo notes, this documents helps you understand how to execute in class exercises|
| __Starter Code Folder__| This is a folder with all the starter code students need for that class.| You should share this folder with students before every lesson.|
| __Solution Folder__| This is a folder with all solution code to code demos and exercises| Share individual solution files as needed. Student should have code demo solutions prior to starting exercises.|
| __Quick Fire__| A programming challenge students must complete in class. aprox 30 min - 1 hour| Some lessons will have a quick fire exercise. Quick fire are meant to be done individually and test the students understanding of the content thus far.|
| __Homework__|Exercise files that are to be completed at home and count towards completed work.| Make sure you have a good grasp on homework requirements. You should explain the homework at the end of the class. Make sure students understand what is required of them. |


###How to Prepare for Each Lesson
We will provide a __private repository__ for your course. This is how you will share ICL files and slides with students. 
Students will fork your repository and use the fork as their class repo.

1.	Read the instructor agenda in the lesson folder.

2.	Read the instructor code demo and exercise notes. Become familiar with what we would like students to accomplish.

3.	View the solution file, and make sure you agree with the solutions. If you don't, change it before you share with students. Students want to feel like you are in command of all materials you share with them.

4.	Decide how you will bring your expertise to the classroom.

5.	__Customize the deck before sharing with the class.__ The slides_xx.md files we provide is a base. You need to update it and make sure it fits the story you want to tell. If you prefer not to use slides, use the markdown file to help you plan the story you will tell this class.

6.	If not using the GA suggested in class labs, create your own and make sure it hits the same topics and learning objectives for that lesson. In the next iteration we will provide an exercise bank.

7.	Post your personalized materials to your course repo.

8.	Made an excellent change? Make note and let us know.


###Slides

We are using reveal.js with markdown 
See [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) for further documentation.

The slides are a skeletal deck and require your input! If there are slides you do not agree with then update them. If you want to introduce topics in a different order, then reorder them.
