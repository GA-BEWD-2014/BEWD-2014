![Exercise - Instructor](../assets/ICL_icons/instr_lab.png)

This lesson is a lab session where students will spend the whole class building. Students will need the solution files as a reference to complete the two labs for this lesson. Make code demo and exercise rails app solutions from lessons 07 - 10 available to students.


##[Ritly](starter_code/)

####Time: 60 min

|------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | forms, routes, controllers, views| 
| __Description__|A Bitly clone that creates a URL alias. |
| __Activity Type__| Pair Programming|


####Instructional Design Notes

*	Students are going to build an app similar to [Bitly](https://bitly.com), called Ritly. In this example we've given students hints to guide and help them determine what routes, views, controllers and models they should create.


*	Students will most likely struggle with flow of control in a Rails app. This is not like any app students have built, but they do have all the skills to complete.
 
*	Students often struggle with task instructions before they being to build. We suggest you demo the app for students prior to them coding. And make sure everyon knows what is expected. 

*	You will most likely need to help students that are struggling with where to start.

##[Rewsly](starter_code/)

###App Description

The City Times needs an app and has hired BEWD students to build it. They want to enter the 21st century and move their print newspaper online. 

You will build Rewsly during lesson 11 & 12.

####Time: 60 min

|------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | forms, queries| 
| __Description__|Students add search functionality to the movies app. |
| __Activity Type__| Pair Programming|


####Instructional Design Notes

*	In this example we give students less hints and require them to think through what routes, views, controllers and models they require. You should encourage them to plan before they code.

*	We want students to get into the habit of breaking the task down intro parts. Don't demo the app this time around, but for those that are struggling with task instructions try to break down the task with them. (i.e. what do I need, what should I do first?)

*	We added 2 bonus questions for those that finish early.
