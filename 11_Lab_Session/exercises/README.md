Time to review. You now have all the necessary knowledge to build a small Rails app. Let's build!

#Ritly
####Time: 60 min

We are going to build an app similar to [Bitly](https://bitly.com), called Ritly. The challenge is going to be understanding the flow of control in a Rails app.
 
View demo [here](http://localhost:3000).


Here is a brief overview of the app. 

* 	Visitors to Ritly will be able to request a randomly generated code for their URL link and save it to the database.
*	Visitors to Ritly can go to ```localhost:3000/random_generated_code``` and the application will redirect them to the  matched link in the database. 
*	Visitors to Ritly can go to ```localhost:3000/random_generated_code/preview``` and preview the mathcing URL link from the database. 


###Task Instructions

We are going to challenge your understanding of a Rails app. With the description and demo above build Ritly.
Use the hints below to help you build.

Here are a few hints. 

####The URLs Table

|id|link |hash code|created at|updated at|
|:---|:----|:--------|:---------|:---------|

####The routes.rb file

```ruby
		Ritly::Application.routes.draw do
  			root "home#index" 
  			resources :urls #only using create, new and show.
  			get '/:some_totally_random_value', to: 'urls#redirectors'
  			get '/:some_totally_random_value/preview', to: 'urls#preview'
		end
```

####The Views

*	show.html.erb 
	*	Visitors are redirected to the show page after they request a randomly generated code for their URL link.
	*	This view will display the random code that was generated: "Your code is: random_code" Go to localhost:3000/random_code to visit your URL.
	

####Generating a Random Number or Hash

*	To generate a random number in Ruy ```rand(1000000)```.
*	__Bonus__: Use SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64(8) to generate a random hash code.
