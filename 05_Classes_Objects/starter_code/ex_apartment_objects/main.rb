# Exercise Goal: This is an exercise in reading and writing code.
# => The purpose of this exercise is to practice creating classes.
# Task Instructions:
# => The main.rb file is where the application starts, and we've given you the code below.
# => Your job is to write the "Apartment", "Building" and "Person" classes.
# => Read the code below and use it to inform what variables and methods are necessary for each of the classes listed above.
# => We've also provided a png file of the terminal output from the completed version.
# => Hint: Think before you code. Annotate code and comment out sections as you test different sections

require_relative 'lib/building_ae'
require_relative 'lib/apartment_ae'
require_relative 'lib/person_ae'

## First, define our methods

def create_apartment
  puts "-----------New Apartment-----------"
  puts "What is the apartment number / name?"
  name = gets.strip

  puts "How many square feet is apartment #{name}?"
  apt_sqft = gets.to_i

  puts "How many bedrooms does apartment #{name} have?"
  apt_bedrooms = gets.to_i

  puts "How many bathrooms does apartment #{name} have?"
  apt_bathrooms = gets.to_i

  Apartment.new(name, apt_sqft, apt_bedrooms, apt_bathrooms)
end

def create_renter
  puts "-----------New Renter-----------"
  puts "What is the renter's name?"
  name = gets.strip

  puts "What is the #{name}'s credit score?"
  credit_score = gets.to_i

  puts "Is #{name} male or female?"
  gender = gets.strip

  Person.new(name, credit_score, gender)
end

def create_building
  puts "-----------New Building-----------"
  puts "What is the building's name?"
  building_name = gets.strip

  puts "What is the building's address?"
  building_address = gets.strip

  Building.new(building_name, building_address)
end

# Now call methods to run the program

puts "******************Welcome to Ruby Building Manager****************** \n \n \n"

building = create_building

puts "How many units are there?"
apt_count = gets.to_i

 0.upto(apt_count - 1) do |unit|
  apartment = create_apartment
  building.apartments[unit] = apartment

  puts "Apartment added successfully \n #{apartment}"

  puts "Is unit #{apartment.name} rented? (y)es (n)o"
  unit_rented = gets.strip

  if unit_rented == "y"
    apartment.renter = create_renter
    puts "Renter added successfully"

    puts "How much is this unit rented for?"
    rent = gets.to_i
    apartment.rent = rent
  end
end

puts "What would you like to do next, (v)iew all apartments, (r) renters (q)uit?"
response = gets.strip

if response == 'v'
  building.view_apartments
elsif response == 'r'
  building.view_renters
else  
  puts "Thanks for using Ruby Building Manager"

end
