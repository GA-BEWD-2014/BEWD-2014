#Explaining classes, objects, attr_accessor & load paths. 
#TIME: 30 min
#INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN NOTES: 
# => This example is to further highlight objects and classes and the need for attr_acessor (note build getters and setters first.
# => Start with a blank document and build. 
# => Give students time to create other instances of apartment, have them experiment with adding/removing renters.
#=> Students will see the Apartment example again, during lab time, students will build a person and building class based on
# code seen in the main.rb file.
