##Class Variables

###Time: 15 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | variable scope, object oriented programs.  | 
| __Description__| Students guess the output without running the code. Then write a brief explanation of what is going on. |    
 


####Instructional Design Notes

*	This is an exercise in reading code. Before we have students write their own object oriented programs, we will have them read first.
*	Have different groups explain the code to you. Validate answers as a class.



##Teddit Objects

###Time: 30 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | variables and method scope. | 
| __Description__| Students complete the Story and StoryBoard classes, by using clues in the teddit.rb and remotesource.rb files. |    
 


####Instructional Design Notes

*	Pair program
*	Before students begin to code coach them through how to start.
*	There is a spec folder for testing, students should ignore this. 


##Secret Number Objects

###Time: Remainder of class

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | object oriented program. | 
| __Description__|Students re-write secret number into an object oriented program.  |    
 


####Instructional Design Notes

*	Provide students with the Secret Number HW1 solution file. They should all start from this point. 
*	This is a lengthy exercise that requires students to refactor code into an object oriented program. There will be time to complete next class. 
*	When reviewing the solutions, let the students take the lead.
