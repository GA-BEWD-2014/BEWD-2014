Notes about specific code alongs are in the code. Here is some additional notes.

##Teddit

Teddit is a Ruby text based news aggregator. Think Reddit in your terminal.

Each Ruby lesson we will incrementally build a news aggregator. From hard coded stories to stories from Mashable, Digg and Reddit APIs. 

NOT ALL code alongs are Teddit

We switch between Teddit code alongs and exercises.
