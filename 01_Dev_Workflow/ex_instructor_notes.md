##Instructor Notes - Exercises

Remember to share the [starter_code](starter_code/) at the beginning of class. Share code_along solutions before lab time so students have an example to reference. 


###[Bash Basics Exercise](starter_code/ex_command_line_basics_exercise.md)

####Time: 20 min

| __Description__| Practice navigating computer files and folders using the terminal.|    
 

####Instructional Design Notes 

*	Students were given pre work, where they were asked to read and try a few commands. For those that did the pre-work,  this will be a simple exercise.

*	To students that struggled with this exercise, should spend some more time practicing with the command line for homework. Make sure to make that clear. Students who fail to grasp using the command line often fall behind quickly. The resources and pre-work docs offer more practice.


###[Git It Together](starter_code/ex_git_it_together.md)

####Time: 15 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | bash commands, terminal, git, GitHub| 
| __Description__| Practice using Git and creating pull request.|    
 

####Instructional Design Notes

*	Students will need to google pull request. This is a good opportunity to teach students that programming involves being able to search for the answer.
