#Movie App

Our client RetFlix wants BEWDiful students to develop an app for them. 

They want an application that allows their users to read and write reviews for  movies in the database. 

We will build a Rails app for RetFlix during lesson 9 -12. Each lesson we will add more functionality to the app. 

Paring is Sharing, and happy coding :)
