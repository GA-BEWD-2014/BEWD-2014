##Database
###Data Persistence

Data is gone when we close our app (i.e. Params do not persist after we close the app).
	
*	Saves data, even after we close the app.
*	Databases are made to handle LOTS of data.
*	Perfect for our apps.


---

##Database
###Vocab

Data: What can we save 

*	text
*	images
*	video

---

##Database
###Vocab

Table: A database is made up of a collection of tables. 

![Table Database](../../assets/rails/tables.png)

---

##Database
###Vocab

SQL: Structured Query Language
A programming language used to search and save data to databases.

	SELECT "movies".* FROM "movies" WHERE "movies"."title" = 'Jaws' LIMIT 1

---

##MVC
###Models & Databases

*	Models are how Rails applications interact with the database.
	*	No SQL required!!!!!	


---

##Model
###Code Along Described

Shirt Management app is an application we will build incrementally during class.

The app allows users to manage their T-Shirts collection, by adding and deleting shirts to the database. 

For this lesson we will add a basic T-Shirt Model.

Demo complete app [here]()

###Shirt Management

Let's Add a T-Shirt Model.

---


##Recap
###Create a new model

	
		rails g model Shirt name:string description:text 
	

---

##Recap
###Rake
	
	rake db:migrate  

---

##Recap
###Rake


*	Task runner for ruby
*	Used to:
	*	Run Migrations
	*	Seed your database

---


<img id ='icon' src="../../assets/ICL_icons/Code_along_icon_md.png">
##Shirt Management

*	Add image field to database (we will create the view next class)
*	Run seeds file

---

##Recap
###Migration

	# defaults
	class AddRatingToMovies < ActiveRecord::Migration 
		def change                                                                       
    		add_column :movies, :rating, :integer, default: 3
    	end 
    end

---


##Recap
###Migration

* Can add fields / columns to existing tables

		# fancy Syntax
			rails g migration AddImageToShirts image:string
---


##Recap
###Migration Types

####string, text, integer, float, decimal, datetime, timestamp, time, date, binary, boolean


---



##Recap
###Seeds

*	Fast and easy way to add data to your tables

	rake db:seeds	

---

<img id ='icon' src="../../assets/ICL_icons/Code_along_icon_md.png">
##Shirt Management

*	Rails Console & Active Record
*	CRUD

---


##Recap
###Active Record

*	The Active Record pattern represents rows of data as objects
*	All database interaction is managed through ActiveRecord objects, no SQL is required*	[ActiveRecord is built into Rails]( http://ar.rubyonrails.org/â€¨http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html)

---


##Recap
###Active Record

Create

	Shirt.create(name: "White Tee")

Read
	
	Shirt.find_by name: "White Tee"

Update

	my_shirt = Shirt.find_by name: "White Tee"
	my_shirt.update description: "GA white T-Shirt"

Delete

	my_shirt = Shirt.find_by name: "White Tee"
	my_shirt.destroy

---


##MVC
###Model View Controller

*	The controller interacts with the model
*	The controller also interacts with the view
*	The view and the model do not interact (need the controller)

![MVC Diagram](../../assets/rails/mvc_diagram.png)


---


##MVC
###Controller

*	Controller intreating with the model

__shirts_controller.rb__

		@shirts = Shirts.all #Returns an array of Shirts (array of hashes)

---

##MVC
###Controller

*	Controller intreating with the view

__shirts/index.html.erb__

		#Can be used in the view
		@shirts 

---


## Homework

## Resources: Models & Active Record

###Cheat Sheet

####Create Models

```bash
	rails g model ModelName attribute_name:migration_type attribute_2:migration_type 
```
*	Use spaces to separate attributes. If you don't list a migration_type (text, integer, float, etc.) the default will be string.
####Migrations

__Migrations__

*	Forgot an attribute / field in your model? Create a migration
	*	Code below adds a field called ratings to the Movies model.

```bash
	rails g migration AddRatingToMovies rating:integer
```

__Seed Files__

*	Populating an entire database with the console would take a while. Use the seeds.rb file.

```bash
rake db:seed
```

__Drop The Database__

*	_You will loose your data if you do this._

```bash
	rake db:drop
```

__Drop database, run migrations, run seeds__

```bash
	rake db:reset
```

####Active Record

__Create__

	```ruby
		Movie.create(title: "Jaws")
	```

__Read__

	```ruby
		Movie.find_by title: "Jaws"
	```
	
	```ruby
		# Returns all movie objects in an array.
		Movie.all
	```

__Update__

	```ruby
		jaws = Movie.find_by title: "Jaws"
		jaws.update description: "Big Shark, bites people"
	```

__Delete__

	```ruby
		jaws.destroy
	```


###Still Feel Lost? 

At the end of this course you should have an understanding of what databases are and the general structure of a database table. In addition you should be familiar with how to create, update and delete records using active record in the Rails console.
