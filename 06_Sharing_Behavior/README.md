=======

###Learning Objectives


*	Create classes that use inheritance to share behavior.

###Schedule

__NOTE:__ This lesson is meant to be on the light side. We want to give instructors time to review / recap weak areas before students head into rails. If you are on time or ahead of schedule, students should use the lab time to finish secret number and/or midterm.
