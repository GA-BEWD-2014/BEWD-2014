##Lesson 6 - Sharing Behavior


###Learning Objectives


*	Create classes that use inheritance to share behavior.
*	Define modules in Ruby program.
*	Define how modules and mixins extend class behavior.




###Schedule

__NOTE:__ This lesson is meant to be on the light side. We want to give instructors time to review / recap weak areas before students head into rails. If you are on time or ahead of schedule, students should use the lab time to finish secret number and/or midterm.
