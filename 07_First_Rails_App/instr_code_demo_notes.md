##Scaffold Books

####Time: 20 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ |Rails application, scaffolding |
| __Objective__| Describe the rails workflow, and development environment |


####Task Instruction

*	Create a new rails app ("My_First_App")
*	Show students Rails created a new folder
*	Go to localhost:3000
*	Scaffold Books with Title, Author and Abstract
*	Restart the server and show students the functionality that was created.

####Instructional Design Notes

The first class is the __ONLY__ time we will scaffold an application. We wanted to give students a quick win and motivate them to continue to learn Rails over the next 7 weeks. In addition, creating an application from the terminal is also a new concept for many and we wanted to introduce students to this workflow.

*	This app allows you to explain abstract concepts with a concrete example.
*	Let students know that scaffolding is not best practice, but a great way to get your feet wet with Rails app development.

##Hosting Public Files
####Time: 15 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ |Public folder, urls and routes|
| __Objective__| Define the public folder and demonstrate how it can be used.|


####Task Instruction

*	Add a file hello.txt that a user can download by going to localhost:3000/hello.txt (using public/) in the books app.

####Instructional Design Notes

*	As an intro to routes, we want students to see that by changing the URL their app will respond differently. In addition, they will learn about the public folder. They will write their own routes next lesson.
