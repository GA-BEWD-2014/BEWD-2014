####Instructional Design Notes: 

*	We want students to have a better understanding of how the Internet works. The reason we ask them to draw first is so you will have a glimpse into how they are thinking. You can then correct any misconceptions.

*	Understanding how the Internet works at a basic level will help students understand the flow of control in their app and better understand routes (routes covered next lesson).
