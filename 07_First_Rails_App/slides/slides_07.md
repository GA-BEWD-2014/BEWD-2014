---


##Scaffolding
###What scaffolding gives us

*	Scaffolds provide the bare necessities for creating, editing, deleting, and viewing a resource. Otherwise known as CRUD.

---



##Scaffolding

Scaffolds are great when getting started with Rails or a new app, but are generally not used in production websites.

---



##Rails
###A bit about Rails

Rails is an open source web framework written in Ruby.

Created by David Heinemeier Hansson (@dhh) in 2004 as an extraction of the reusable components of Basecamp.

##Rails & My Browser
###The Internet

*	To understand Rails we need to understand the Internet.

---



<img id ='icon' src="../../assets/ICL_icons/Exercise_icon_md.png">
##Draw The Internet

*	Get into groups of 2-3.
*	Draw a diagram that represents your understanding of how the Internet works. Here are a couple of questions to consider as you draw.
	*	What happens when you hit enter on your address bar?
	*	Where does a website live?

We will discuss how the internet works at a high level next.

##Rails & My Browser
###The Internet

![Internet Diagram](../../assets/rails/internet.png)

---


##Rails & My Browser
###The request/response cycle

*	HTTP (the protocol that drives the Web) communicates via input/output just like the terminal.

*	Browsers send input (the request) and the server returns output (the response).

![Request Response Diagram](../../assets/rails/response_request.png)

##Structure Of A Rails App
###my_first_rails_app


![App Structure](../../assets/rails/app_structure.png)

*	Most of your application logic belongs to app/ (including css and javascript files)

*	public/ contains static files that are directly available

---




##Structure Of A Rails App
### The app folder

Most of the code we write belongs somewhere in the `app` folder.

* `app/assets`: CSS, JavaScript and images used in templates.
* `app/controllers`: Classes which gather data and render responses for specific
  requests.
* `app/helpers`: Utility modules which define methods for templates to use.
* `app/mailers`: Classes that define various outbound emails in your app.
* `app/models`: Classes defining your data models (e.g.. User, Comment, Post).
* `app/views`: Templates called by your controllers to render HTML.
* `app/views/layouts`: Master templates to be used throughout your website.

More about app structure in following class.

##Public Means

Add a static file to public.

* Create the file `public/hello.txt`
* Start your server with `$ rails s`
* Visit http://localhost:3000/hello.txt

## Homework

<img id ='icon' src="../../assets/ICL_icons/Exercise_icon_md.png">
##Lab Time

*	Create a new application called User_Scaffold. 
*	The resource should be `User` and it should have the attributes: 
	*	First Name
	*	Last Name
	*	Age
	*	Email

__BONUS!__ Remove the ability to edit after a user has been created

_Hint:_ app/views

###Cheat Sheet

####What is a Framework?


...a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user written code.

&dash; via Wikipedia
You use libraries, frameworks use you.

####Creating a new Rails app

```bash
$ rails new app_name
```

*   This will create a project folder and some useful files for you. 
*   Don't forget to cd into your new directory before you move on.

####Running the server.

```bash
$ rails server
```

* Now you can visit http://localhost:3000/ and see your app.

###Still Feel Lost? 

This lesson we really want you to have a general understanding of how the internet works. Here are some resources to help you dive deeper and review what you learned in class. 

####Catch Up With These Resources

* Five minute [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc) on how the internet works.
