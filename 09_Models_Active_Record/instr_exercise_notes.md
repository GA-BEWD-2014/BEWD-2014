Remember to share the [starter_code](starter_code/) at the beginning of class. Share completed code_demo files before lab time so students have an example to reference. 

#Movie App

Our client RetFlix wants BEWD students to develop.

They want an application that allows visitors to:

*	View all movies in the database. 
*	Add a new movie to the database.
*	Edit a movie in the database. 
*	And search for a specific movie.

Students will build a Rails app for RetFlix during lesson 9 & 10. Each lesson will add more functionality to the app.
