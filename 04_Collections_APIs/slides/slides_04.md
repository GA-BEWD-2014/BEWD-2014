##Quick Fire
###Fizz Buzz

TIME : 30 min

*	Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. 

*	But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 

*	For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

##Working With Collections
###Let's get practical


---


##APIs
###Application Programming Interface


---


##APIs
###Working with APIs

1.	Ask for some data
2. Convert it into a format we can work with
3. Do cool stuff

---


##API
###Ask for Data


*	We need to use a gem to ask for data.
		
		$ gem install rest-client

---


##API
###Convert into a format we can work with


*	JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
		
		'{"NY":"New York","LA":"Los Angeles","SYD":"Sydney","LDN":"London"}'

###Cheat Sheet

####Array of Hashes

```ruby
	super_heros =[{ hero: 'Batman', secret_identity: 'Bruce Wayne'}, 
	{hero: 'Superman', secret_identity: 'Clark Kent'}, 
	{hero: 'Spiderman', secret_identity: 'Peter Parker'}]
```


####.each & .map

```ruby
	super_heros.map do |super_hero| 
		puts "#{super_hero[:hero]} is #{super_hero[:secret_identity]}"
	end
```
	
```ruby
	super_heros.each do |super_hero| 
		puts "#{super_hero[:hero]} is #{super_hero[:secret_identity]}"
	end
```

*	.each returns the original array. 
*	Map returns a new array with the results you added.
