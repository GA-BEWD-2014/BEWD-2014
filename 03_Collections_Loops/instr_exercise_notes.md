| __Topics__ | times iterator, .downto | 
| __Description__| Students create a program that prints the lyrics to "99 bottles of beer on the wall"|    
 


####Instructional Design Notes

-	There is no code along for loops. Provide general syntax and allow students to work through the problem. We are training students to use documentation.
-	Students should pair program on this.
-	Walk students through the exercise instructions and address any questions before they begin.
-	Encourage the use of Ruby docs.


##Arrays

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | arrays and array methods |

####Instructional Design Notes
-	Students start with completed code from Teddit Conditional exercise.
-	This exercise is difficult. The goal is to have students become familiar with hashes and iteration to better understanding of APIs and Params during Rails.
-	Allow students to complete part 1. As a class and discuss the answers.
-	Then complete part 2.
