# We are going to begin to create a "Magic 8-Ball" program! It will provide a random response 
# to users. First we need to populate the array with possible responses and practice outputting responses to the user.
# If you are not aware of what a Magic 8-Ball is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball
#
# 1. Begin by creating a simple array called `responses` that holds these
#    three String values:
#
#    - "It is certain"
#    - "Reply hazy, try again"
#    - "Don't count on it"



# 2. Print to the screen, "Your answer is:" and print the second value
#    of the Array as well.


# 3. Add three more values to your `responses` Array by using `push` method.
#
#    - "It is decidedly so"
#    - "Ask again later"
#    - "My reply is no"
#
#    Print the entire array to the screen to see what your array
#    looks like.


# 4. Remove the first value from your Array ("It is certain") using
#    shift method and print your Array again. 


# 5. Add a new item to the front of your Array by using the `unshift`
#    method.
#
#    - "As I see it, yes"
#
#    And print your Array one more time to make sure it's correct!
