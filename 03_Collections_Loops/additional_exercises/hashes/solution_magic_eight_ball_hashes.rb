# Introduction to Ruby on Rails
# Note this is a cumulative example 

# Exercise ICL_hashes
# Learning Objective: Practice hashes and ruby syntax.
# Prerequisite => a code along that introduced arrays and completed ex_arrays.rb

# Continuing with our Magic 8-Ball, let's switch it up a bit. A Magic 8-Ball includes 20 answers, which can be construed as being
#    "positive", "negative" or "neutral". You will need this to complete the activity: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball.

# 1. Create a Hash called `responses` that has the key :positive and its value pair
#    includes all of the positive answers from the Wikipedia page as an
#    Array.
#
#    Print the Array to the screen.
#
#    puts "Positive Responses: #{responses[:positive].to_s}"

responses = { :positive => [ "It is certain", "It is decidedly so",
                             "Without a doubt", "Yes - definitely",
                             "You may rely on it", "As I see it, yes",
                             "Most likely", "Outlook good", "Yes",
                             "Signs point to yes" ] }

puts "Positive Responses: #{responses[:positive].to_s}"

# 2. Now that you have created your basic Hash, go and add the negative
#    and neutral responses as well by creating new keys.

responses[:neutral] = [ "Reply hazy, try again", "Ask again later",
                        "Better not tell you now", "Cannot predict now",
                        "Concentrate and ask again" ]

responses[:negative] = [ "Don't count on it", "My reply is no",
                         "My sources say no", "Outlook not so good",
                         "Very doubtful" ]

# 3. Finally, we can now play around with our Hash and Arrays to find
#    out some information about them.
#
#    Check to see if the Hash has the key `:positive`

puts "Has key positive? #{responses.has_key?(:positive)}"

# 4. Check to see if it has the key `:cruel`

puts "Has key cruel? #{responses.has_key?(:cruel)}"

# 5. Play around with more options by looking at the RubyDoc info:
#    http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.htmlÂ 

puts "Hash size: #{responses.size}"

puts "Hash empty?: #{responses.empty?}"
