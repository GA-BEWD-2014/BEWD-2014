# Continuing with our Magic 8-Ball, let's switch it up a bit. A Magic 8-Ball includes 20 answers, which can be construed as being
#    "positive", "negative" or "neutral". You will need this to complete the activity: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball.

# 1. Create a Hash called `responses` that has the key :positive and its value pair
#    includes all of the positive answers from the Wikipedia page as an
#    Array.
#
#    Print the Array to the screen.
#
#    puts "Positive Responses: #{responses[:positive].to_s}"



# 2. Now that you have created your basic Hash, go and add the negative
#    and neutral responses as well by creating new keys.



# 3. Finally, we can now play around with our Hash and Arrays to find
#    out some information about them.
#
#    Check to see if the Hash has the key `:positive`



# 4. Check to see if it has the key `:cruel`



# 5. Play around with more options by looking at the RubyDoc info:
#    http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.htmlÂ
