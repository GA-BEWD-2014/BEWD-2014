# 1. display each province, followed by its abbreviation, each on its own line
puts "\n--------------------" # line to distinguish exercise output


# 2. using the .each method, display the months in the second quarter of the year, in a single row
puts "\n--------------------" # line to distinguish exercise output


# 3. display the current year, followed by the third quarter months, and the same for the next two years, as shown
# 
# 2012: July August September
# 2013: July August September
# 2014: July August September
#
# there are many different ways you could do this, but you will need to nest one loop inside another.
# for this exercise, do not use the .each method in either loop
puts "\n--------------------" # line to distinguish exercise output
