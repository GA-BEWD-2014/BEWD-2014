###Schedule


| Time        | Topic| Materials| Comments |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| 20 min | Review| lesson 2 material|Review student questions before moving on to new content.| 
| 25 min | Iteration | ex - [loop.rb](instr_exercise_notes.md)|No code along here. Students will use what is on the slides and ruby docs to complete the iteration exercise.|
| 50 min | Arrays|code demo - [instr_array.rb](instr_code_demos/instr_array.rb) <br> ex -[arrays.rb](instr_exercise_notes.md)| |
| 25 min | Hases | code demo - [instr_collections_management.rb](instr_code_demos/instr_collection_management.rb)| Focus is on understanding the logic behind hashes. Less on syntax|
| 60 min | Lab Time|ex - [teddit_hashes.rb](instr_exercise_notes.md) | Includes working with arrays and hashes. |



###Homework

-	Students continue work on Secret Number. Due next class (lesson 4)
