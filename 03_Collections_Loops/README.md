Lesson 3: Collections & Iteration 
========

Learning Objectives
--------
-	Define arrays, hashes and differentiate between the two.
-	Describe iteration in computational thinking and relate to loops.
-	Apply loops to manipulate collections  (arrays and hashes). 



Schedule
--------

| Time        | Topic| Materials| Comments |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| 20 min | Review|[coa_instr_ more_about_methods.rb](code_alongs/coa_instr_more_about_methods.rb)| In an effort to save time, review method syntax while introducing more method syntax. | 
| 25 min | Iteration | [ex_loop.rb](exercises/ex_loop.rb)|No code along here. Students will use what is on the slides and ruby docs to complete the iteration exercise.|
| 50 min | Arrays|[coa_instr_array.rb](code_alongs/coa_instr_array.rb) <br> [ex_arrays.rb](exercises/ex_arrays.rb)| |
| 25 min | Hases | [coa_instr_collections_management.rb](code_alongs/coa_instr_collection_management.rb)| Focus is on understanding the logic behind hashes. Less on syntax|
| 60 min | Lab Time|[ex_teddit_hashes.rb](exercises/ex_teddit_hashes.rb) | Includes working with arrays and hashes. |



HOMEWORK
--------
-	Students continue work on Secret Number. Due next class (lesson 4)
