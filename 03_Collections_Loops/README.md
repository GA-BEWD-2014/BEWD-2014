| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| 20 min | Review| lesson 2 material|Review student questions before moving on to new content.| 
| 25 min | Iteration | [ex_loop.rb](exercises/ex_loop.rb)|No code along here. Students will use what is on the slides and ruby docs to complete the iteration exercise.|
| 50 min | Arrays|[coa_instr_array.rb](code_alongs/coa_instr_array.rb) <br> [ex_arrays.rb](exercises/ex_arrays.rb)| |
| 25 min | Hases | [coa_instr_collections_management.rb](code_alongs/coa_instr_collection_management.rb)| Focus is on understanding the logic behind hashes. Less on syntax|
| 60 min | Lab Time|[ex_teddit_hashes.rb](exercises/ex_teddit_hashes.rb) | Includes working with arrays and hashes. |
