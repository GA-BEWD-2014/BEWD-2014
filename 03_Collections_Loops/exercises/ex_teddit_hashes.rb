# Step 1: Working with Arrays and Hashes

# Copy your solution from conditional_teddit.rb. 
# Create an empty stories array. This will be used to hold all stories we capture.
# Users enter the story as they do now, but it gets put in a hash instead. 
# Update any reference to the story (upvotes, category and title) 
# Your story hash should look like the one below: 
# { title: "Monkeys thank mayor for flounder tooth necklace", category: "Teeth", upvotes: 1 }
# Add the hash to an array called stories and print "Story: Monkeys thank mayor for flounder tooth necklace, Category: (Teeth), Current Upvotes: 1"
# Using the stories array 
# Test your cat, bacon, and food upvote conditional logic.
#
# Step 2: Adding Loops 
# Use a loop, so that your program continues to ask a user for stories until they chose to quit. ("Would you like to add another story? Enter 'y' or 'n'")
# Once the user is finished with entering their stories, use .each to print each story in the stories array.
