# Copy your solution from conditional_exercise.rb
# Create an empty stories array. This will be used to hold all of our stories we capture.
# Users enter the story as they do now, but it gets put in a hash instead. 
# Update any reference to the story, upvotes and category string along the way
# Break out the user input so the hash looks like the one below 
# { title: "Monkeys thank mayor for flounder tooth necklace", category: "Teeth", upvotes: 1 }
# Add this hash to an array called stories and print "Story: Monkeys thank mayor for flounder tooth necklace, Category: (Teeth), Current Upvotes: 1"
# Through the stories array 
# Test your cat, bacon, and food upvote upgrades work.
