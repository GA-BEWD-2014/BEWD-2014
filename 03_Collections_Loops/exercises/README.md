| __Topics__ | times iterator, .downto | 
| __Description__| Students create a program that prints the lyrics to "99 bottles of beer on the wall"|    
 


####Instructional Design Notes

-	There is no code along for loops. Provide general syntax and allow students to work through the problem. We are training students to use documentation.
-	Students should pair program on this.
-	Walk students through the exercise instructions and address any questions before they begin.
-	Encourage the use of Ruby docs.


##Arrays

###Time: 20 min

| | |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | arrays and array methods | 
| __Description__| This file asks students a series of questions about arrays. The goal is to have them research array methods and practice. There is a test built into this exercise to verify student answers.   |    
 

####Instructional Design Notes
-	Explain the purpose of the test
-	Students should pair program on this.
-	Encourage the use of Ruby docs.


## Teddit Hashes

###Time: 45 min

| __Topics__ | hashes and arrays | 
| __Description__| Students update Teddit to include a stories array that holds a story hash. This is the final step before we pull stories using an api. |    
 

####Instructional Design Notes
-	Students start with completed code from Teddit Conditional exercise.
-	This exercise is difficult. The goal is to have students become familiar with hashes and iteration to better understanding of APIs and Params during Rails.
-	Allow students to complete part 1. As a class and discuss the answers.
-	Then complete part 2.
