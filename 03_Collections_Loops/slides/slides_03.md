##Iteration

##Iteration - Ruby'esque Loops
###Times Iterator

	3.times do
  		puts “going...”
	end
	puts gone
	
	# going...
	# going...
	# going...
	# gone
---


##Iteration - Ruby'esque Loops
###.upto
	
	1.upto(3) do |num|
  		puts “#{num}. going”
	end

	# 1. going
	# 2. going
	# 3. going

---


##Iteration - Ruby'esque Loops
###.downto
	
	3.downto(1) do |guess|
  		puts "You have #{guess} guesses left"
	end

	# You have 3 guesses left
	# You have 2 guesses left
	# You have 1 guesses left

---



##Iteration - Other Loops
###Less common in Ruby 

*	These loops are less common in Ruby, but good to know as a programmer.
	
	*	While 
	*	loop do
		
See syntax in the resources section.
 
---


##Iteration - Other Loops
###They all do the same thing… 'kinda'

	10.downto(1) do |count|
  		puts "Looping"
	end

	count = 10
	while count > 0
  		puts "Looping"
  	count -= 1
	end

	count = 10 
	until count < 1
  		puts "Looping"
  	count -= 1
	end

	count = 10
	loop do
  		break if count < 1
  		puts "Looping"
  	count -= 1
	end

##Iteration Recap
###Recap

* 	Iteration in programming allows us to keep our code DRY
* 	Loops are used to repeat lines of code
* 	Common or Ruby'esque loops are
	*	.times
	*	.upto
	*	.downto
	* 	.each (we will see in a moment)

##Collections
###Working with Collections in Ruby

---


##Collections
###Arrays

![accordion folder](../../assets/ruby/accordian.jpg)

---


##Arrays
###Find by Index

![Array Indexing](../../assets/ruby/array_index_diagram.png)

---


##Arrays
###Find by Index

	my_array = ["NYC", "LA", "SYD", "LDN"]
	my_array[0]  #=> "NYC"
	my_array[1]  #=> "LA"
	my_array[-1] #=> "SYD"

---


##Arrays
###Find by Position

![Array position](../../assets/ruby/arrays_position_diagram.png)

##Arrays
###Find by Position

	my_array = ["NYC", "LA", "SYD", "LDN"]
	my_array.first  #=> "NYC"
	my_array.last #=> "LDN"


	# In rails...
	# Will not work in IRB
	my_array = ["NYC", "LA", "SYD", "LDN"]
	my_array.second
	my_array.third
	my_array.forth
	my_array.fifth
	my_array.forty_two # known as the reddit

---


##Arrays
###Methods w/ Arrays

	name = "Steven"
	name.upcase

	my_array = [["NYC", "LA", "SYD", "LDN"]
	my_array.reverse

##Arrays
###Recap


*	A collection of data
*	Can search an array by index or position
*	Arrays are objects and therefore have methods we can call on them.

##Collections
###Hashes

![Labeled Accordion](../../assets/ruby/labeled_accordian.jpeg)

##Hases
###Find by key

	ga_markets = {"NYC" => "New York City", "LA" => "Los Angeles", "SYD" => "Sydney", "LDN" => "London"}
	
	ga_markets["NYC"]	#=> "New York City"
	ga_markets[["LA"]	#=> "Los Angeles"
	ga_markets[["SYD"]	#=> "Sydney"

---


##Hases
###Setting Values

	user_hash = {}
	user_hash["name"] = "Steven"
	user_hash["favorite_color"] = "Green"

	user_hash #=> {"name"=>"Steven", "favorite_color"=>"Green"}

---


##Hases
###Symbols

-	Commonly used for hashes
	
		:i_am_a_symbol

##Symbols
###Commonly used as keys for hashes

	ga_markets = {
  		:NYC  => "New York City", 
  		:LA => "Los Angeles", 
  		:SYD => "Sydney", 
  		:LDN => "London"
	}

---



##Hash
###Messages

	user = {
  		user_name: "StevenNunez",
  		email:     "steven.nunez@gmail.com"
	}
	
	user.has_key? :email #=> true
	user.key? :email #=> true
	user.include? :email #=> true
	
	user.has_value? "StevenNunez" #=> true

---



##Collections
###Array of Hashes


	user = [
  			{:user => "Steven Nunez",      :role => "Instructor"}, 
  			{:user => "Eddie Washington",  :role => "Teacher's Assistant"}, 
  			{:user => "Stephanie Morillo", :role => "Teacher's Assistant"}, 
	]


	# Alternate syntax
	users = [
  			{user: "Steven Nunez",      role: "Instructor"}, 
  			{user: "Eddie Washington",  role: "Teacher's Assistant"}, 
  			{user: "Stephanie Morillo", role: "Teacher's Assistant"}, 
	]

##Iterating Over Collections
###.each

	ga_markets = ["NYC", "LA", "SYD", "LDN"]

	ga_markets.each {|market| puts name}

###Cheat Sheet

####Arrays

__Creating Arrays__

```ruby
my_array = ["Apples", "Oranges", "Pears"] 
```

> ["Apples", "Oranges", "Pears"]

```ruby
my_array = Array.new
```

> []

```ruby
Array.new(3)
```  

> [nil, nil, nil]

```ruby
Array.new(3, "BEWD") 
```

> ["BEWD", "BEWD", "BEWD"]

__Assessing Elements__

```ruby
arr = ["NYC", "LDN", "LA", "SF", "BOS", "BER"]
arr[0]
arr[100] 
arr[-3] 
```

> NYC

> nil

> SF

```ruby
arr[2, 3] #=> [3, 4, 5]
```

> ["LA", "SF", "BOS"]

```ruby
arr[1..4] 
```

> [LDN, LA, SF, BOS]

####Hashes

	```ruby
	GA_Markets = { "New York City"=>"NYC", "London"=>"LDN", "Los 	Angeles"=>"LA", "San Francisco"=>"SF", "Boston"=>"BOS", 	"Berlin"=>"BER" }

	GA_Markets["London"]
	```

> "LDN"

	```ruby
	super_heros = { batman: "Bruce Wayne", superman: "Clark Kent", 	spiderman: "Peter Parker"}

	super_heros[:superman]
	```
	
> "Clark Kent"

####Loops

__Iterator loop__

```ruby
4.times do
  puts "This will be printed 4 times"
end 
```

> This will be printed 4 times

> This will be printed 4 times

> This will be printed 4 times

> This will be printed 4 times

__Each Loop__

	```ruby
		# A list of GA Courses
		courses = [ "FEWD", "BEWD", "CSF" ]

	names.each do|n|
  		puts "GA has a course on #{n}"
	end
	```

> GA has a course on FEWD

> GA has a course on BEWD

> GA has a course on CSF
