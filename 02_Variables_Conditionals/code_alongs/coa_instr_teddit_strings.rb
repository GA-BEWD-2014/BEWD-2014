#TEDDIT:  Strings
#TIME: 15 min
#INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN NOTES: 
# => We take an incremental approach so students can build on their understanding of strings.
# => Each version below, adds complexity to Teddit. Comment out each version before running the next.


#Version 1 - Welcome the user to Teddit, print the first story to the terminal.
###########
###########
# 
puts 'Welcome to Teddit! a text based news aggregator. Get today\'s news tomorrow!'
puts 'Story: Man raised by wolverines, then eaten Current upvotes: 4'


#Version 2 - Replace the story title and upvotes with variables.
###########
###########
##Swap out the story and upvotes for variables
##Show casting error
#
#puts 'Welcome to Teddit! a text based news aggregator. Get today\'s news tomorrow!'
#puts 'Story: Man raised by wolverines, then eaten Current upvotes: 4'
#
#story = 'Cat makes fortune by showing elderly how to play dice'
#upvotes = 7
#puts 'Story: ' + story
#puts 'Story: ' + story + ' Current upvotes: ' + upvotes

#Woot error!
#Talk about mixing type and casting. Numbers have methods so we can call #to_s


#Version 3 - Add data type casting (fix casting issue).
###########
###########
##Fix casting issue
#
#puts 'Welcome to Teddit! a text based news aggregator. Get today\'s news tomorrow!'
#puts 'Story: Man raised by wolverines, then eaten Current upvotes: 4'
#
#story = 'Cat makes fortune by showing elderly how to play dice'
#upvotes = 7
#puts 'Story: ' + story + ' Current upvotes: ' + upvotes.to_s


#Version 4 - Use string interpolation and escape characters, polish the output.
###########
###########
##Remove need to escape single quotes by using Double quoted strings
##Introduce Interpolation
##Introduce \n and \t
#
#puts "Welcome to Teddit! a text based news aggregator. Get today's news tomorrow!"
#puts "Story: Man raised by wolverines, then eaten Current upvotes: 4"
#
#story = "Cat makes fortune by showing elderly how to play dice"
#upvotes = 7
#puts "Story: #{story.capitalize} \nCurrent upvotes: \t#{upvotes}"

#Version 5 - Adding methods
###########
###########
#def show_title(title)
  #puts title
#end
#
#def show_story(story, upvotes)
  #puts "Story: #{story.capitalize} Current upvotes: #{upvotes}"
#end
#
#show_title("Welcome to Teddit! a text based news aggregator. Get today's news tomorrow!")
#
#story1 = "Cat makes fortune by showing elderly how to play dice"
#story1_upvotes = 7
#
