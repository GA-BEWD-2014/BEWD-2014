#Teddit is a Ruby text based news aggregator. Think Reddit in your terminal.
#This exercise will be used throughout the ruby portion of this course. 
#Each lesson we will incrementally build a news aggregator. 
#First we will hard code stories into the code.
#Eventually we will create a more dynamic Teddit, and pull the latest news stories from Mashable, Digg and Reddit. 

#This code along demonstrates how to work with strings. 
#Each version below, adds complexity to Teddit. Comment out each version before running the next.


#Version 1 - Welcome the user to Teddit, print the first story to the terminal.

###########
#
#'Welcome to Teddit! a text based news aggregator. Get today\'s news tomorrow!'
#'Story: Man raised by wolverines, then eaten Current upvotes: 4'


#Version 2 - Replace the story title and upvotes with variables.
