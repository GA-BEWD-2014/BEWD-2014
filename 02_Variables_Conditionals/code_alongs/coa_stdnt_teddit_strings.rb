#Teddit is a Ruby text based news aggregator. Think Reddit in your terminal.
#This exercise will be used throughout the ruby portion of this course. 
#Each lesson we will incrementally build a news aggregator. 
#First we will hard code stories into the code.
#Eventually we will create a more dynamic Teddit, and pull the latest news stories from Mashable, Digg and Reddit. 

#This code along demonstrates how to work with strings. 
#Each version below, adds complexity to Teddit. Comment out each version before running the next.
