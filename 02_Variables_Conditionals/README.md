##Lesson 2 - Variables & Conditional Logic

###Learning Objectives


*	Define computational thinking and translate instructions into basic pseudo code.
*	Define variables and data types.
*	Utilize conditional logic and variables to create a simple Ruby program.


###Schedule


| Time        | Topic| GA ICLs| Comments |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| 15 min | Intro To Programming | ex - [Robot Pseudo Code](instr_exercise_notes.md) | Work on this for homework. |
| 55 min | IRB, Variables & Methods | code demo - [instr_demo_variables](instr_code_demos/instr_demo_variables.rb)<br/> code demo -[instr_demo_methods](instr_code_demos/instr_demo_methods.rb)| The variables & methods code-alongs are probably the most critical code-demo of the entire Ruby section. Lots of important material. If students have issues, continue with the rest of material and review again next lesson (there is a review period at start of lesson 3) |
| 20 min | Teddit Strings | code demo - [instr_teddit_strings](instr_code_demos/instr_teddit_strings.rb)| |
| 15 min | Booleans | code demo - [instr_boolean](instr_code_demos/instr_boolean.rb) | |
| 15 min | Conditionals |  | There is no code demo for this topic. We will start to pull back so that students can test their knowledge of programming based on your explanation slides, and resources from the Internet. |
| 30 min | Lab Time | [ex_conditional](instr_exercise_notes) | Work on this for homework. |


###Homework

-	[Secret_Number 1](homework/HW_01.rb).
-	Demo the Secret Number homework before end of class.

Homework is due lesson 4.
