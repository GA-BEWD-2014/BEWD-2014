##Lesson 2 - Variables & Conditional Logic

###Learning Objectives


*	Define computational thinking and translate instructions into basic pseudo code.
*	Define variables and data types.
*	Utilize conditional logic and variables to create a simple Ruby program.


###Schedule


| Time        | Topic| GA ICLs| Comments |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| 15 min | irb | [coa_instr_irb.rb](instr_code_demos/instr_irb.rb) | |
| 45 min | Variables & Methods | [coa_instr_demo_variables](instr_code_demos/instr_demo_variables.rb)<br/>[coa_instr_demo_methods](instr_code_demos/instr_demo_methods.rb)| The variables & methods code-alongs are probably the most critical code-along of the entire Ruby section. Lots of important material. If students have issues, continue with the rest of material and review again next lesson (there is a review period at start of lesson 3) |
| 30 min | Teddit Strings | [coa_instr_teddit_strings](instr_code_demos/instr_teddit_strings.rb)| |
| 15 min | Booleans | [coa_instr_boolean](instr_code_demos/instr_boolean.rb) | |
| 15 min | Conditionals |  | There is no code along for this topic. We will start to pull back so that students can test their knowledge of programming based on your explanation and slides. |
| 30 min | Lab Time | [ex_strings_teddit](instr_exercise_notes)<br>[ex_conditional](instr_exercise_notes) | If time does not permit, work on this for homework. |

###Homework

- Finish Teddit Strings Exercise
-	[Secret_Number 1](homework/HW_01.rb).
-	Demo the Secret Number homework before end of class.

Homework is due lesson 4.
