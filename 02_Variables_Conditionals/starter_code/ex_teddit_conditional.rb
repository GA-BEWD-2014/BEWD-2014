# Teddit Contionals - Starter Code.

# Let's add a new Teddit feature. Upvotes!
# Complete the application below. 
# Where you see comments (lines that begin with #) replace it with code so that the program works.

def get_input
  #Get input from the user.
end

def calculate_upvotes(story, category)
	# Write code so that:
		# If the Story is about cats multiply the upvotes by 5
		# If the Story is about bacon multiply the upvotes by 8
		# If the Story is about Food it gets 3 times the upvotes.

	#For example:
	# "Cats frolic despite tuna shortage" should give you 5 times the upvotes!
