#TEDDIT:  Strings - Student's File
#	Teddit is a Ruby text based news aggregator. Think Reddit in your terminal.
#	This exercise will be used throughout the ruby portion of this course. 
#	Each lesson we will incrementally build a news aggregator. 
#	Lesson 4 we will create a more dynamic Teddit, and pull the latest news stories from Mashable, Digg and Reddit. 
#	But until then we will hard code stories.


#This code along demonstrates how to work with strings. 
#Each version below, adds complexity to Teddit. Only run one version at a time so you can see the difference.


#Version 1 - Welcome the user to Teddit, print the first story to the terminal.

#'Welcome to Teddit! a text based news aggregator. Get today\'s news tomorrow!'
#'Story: Man raised by wolverines, then eaten Current upvotes: 4'
