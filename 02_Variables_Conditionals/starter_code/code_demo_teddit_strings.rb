#TEDDIT:  Strings - Student's File
#	Teddit is a Ruby text based news aggregator. Think Reddit in your terminal.
#	This exercise will be used throughout the ruby portion of this course. 
#	Each lesson we will incrementally build a news aggregator. 
#	Lesson 4 we will create a more dynamic Teddit, and pull the latest news stories from Mashable, Digg and Reddit. 
#	But until then we will hard code stories.


#This code along demonstrates how to work with strings. 
#Each version below, adds complexity to Teddit. Only run one version at a time so you can see the difference.


#Version 1 - Welcome the user to Teddit, print the first story to the terminal.
###########
###########
#
# puts'Welcome to Teddit! a text based news aggregator. Get today\'s news tomorrow!'
# puts'Story: Man raised by wolverines, then eaten Current upvotes: 4'


#Version 2 - Replace the story title and upvotes with variables.
headline = "FBI doesn't like weed"
upvotes = 10
puts "story: " + headline + "\nCurrent Upvotes:\t" + upvotes.to_s
# or puts "Story: #{headline} \nCurrent Upvoates:\t #{upvotes.to_s}

#Version 3 - Add data type casting (fix casting issue).
