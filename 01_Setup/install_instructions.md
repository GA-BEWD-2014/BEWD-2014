Windows Users:

	Ruby Installer:
		The install on Windows is actually very with the bundle from rubyinstaller.org; Just be sure to grab the 1.9.3 version, as that will be the version we will be using in class. This will set up your environment and you can start running ruby files right away. Rails will be just a matter of install the rails gem

		http://railsinstaller.org/

	Extra command line tools: 
		We will be using the command line a lot here. On Windows I also like to install gow. Gow is a bunch of unix command line tools ported to Windows. It will make it easy to follow in class with the same commands as your Mac buddies. https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki
