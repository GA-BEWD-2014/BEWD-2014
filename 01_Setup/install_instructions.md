##Apple Mac Users 

1.	__Make sure you have an apple ID__ (you should already have one). 

2.	__Xcode installed?__
	*	Go to step 4

3.	__Xcode not installed?__ 

	* Go to: [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
	
	* Log in with your Apple ID and password (same as iTunes).

	* Install Command Line Tools for your operating system.

	* Check install: ```$ gcc --version```


4.	__Install homebrew from terminal:__

	* ```$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)```

	* After install is complete: ```$ brew doctor```

		__If you get following error:__ 
		
		"Warning: Experimental support for using Xcode without the "Command Line Tools".
		
		Go back to step 1.


5.	__Install Git__

	
	* ```$ brew update```
	
	* ```$ brew install git```

	* Check install:

		* ```$ which git```

		should get:	 
		
			/use/local/bin/git

6.	__Configure Git with your Name and Email__

	Make sure you use the same email address for Git, GitHub, and Heroku.

7.	__Install RVM with Ruby 2.0.0__

	* ```$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails --autolibs=enable```

	 This will take a few minutes, and once itâ€™s done, quit and relaunch Terminal, then run this command:

	* ```$ type rvm | head -1```
	
	 If you get rvm is a function, that means RVM was successfully installed. 

	* Make sure the latest versions of RVM, Ruby and Rails were installed, run the commands below:

		* For RVM

		```$ rvm -v```
			
		You should get 
				
			rvm 2.0.0 or higher.
		* For Ruby

		```$ ruby -v```
			
		You should get 
					
			ruby 2.0.0p0 or higher.

		* For Rails

		```$ rails -v```
			
		You should get 
				
			Rails 3.2.13 or higher.


##Windows Users

Ruby Installer:

To get started you are going to use the Rails installer by rubyinstaller.org, and then schedule time with the instructional team to upgrade your Ruby and Rails versions after class.


*	Go to [http://railsinstaller.org/](http://railsinstaller.org/).
*	Grab the 1.9.3 version (we will upgrade later). This will set up your environment and you can start working with git right away.
		

__Extra command line tools: __
	
We will be using the command line a lot during this course. On Windows we also suggest installing gow. Gow is a bunch of unix command line tools ported to Windows. It will make it easy to follow in class with the same commands as your Mac buddies. https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki


##Happy Coding :)

__You're ready for the first class.__
