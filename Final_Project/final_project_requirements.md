BEWD: FINAL PROJECT
--------

#DESCRIPTION
For the final project you will use your knowledge of back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. You will choose the type of web application you’d like to create. Don’t worry; you have some time to think about what you would like to do.

The objective of this project is to:

- Demonstrate understanding of all topics covered during this course.

- Apply knowledge gained during this course by building a web application from the ground up.

The final encapsulates everything you’ve learned in this course. We want to make sure you are successful in your venture, so to stay on track we suggest you take our milestone suggestions seriously. In addition, we will help define scope and guide you through the process.


##CORE REQUIREMENTS
To pass projects must include:

-	About page/or a detailed descript of your app.

-	User accounts. Your application must utilize user accounts.

- 	Security Features. Login credentials must be validated before users can gain access to your application. 

- 	Hosted. No need to pay for hosting services, you can use GitHub and Heroku. 

- 	Ruby Gems. Use a Ruby Gem (not the Rails defaults, obviously they don't count). Some ideas to look into: devise or paper clip, carrier wave.

- 	Handles invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. (i.e. validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords).

- 	Make use of associations. At least two of your models should be associated.

|Week 10| Final version|


##DELIVERABLES
Your project will be deployed to Heroku and your source code will be submitted via GitHub. You will share the link for both with your instructor.

##BEST PRACTICES
Your instructor and T.As will provide feedback on how well you execute best practices. Even though it is not part of the requirements, you should keep these in mind. 

* Clean And Readable Code. Instructors and T.As should be able to read and follow code easily.  Maintain clean and readable code including: consistent indentation, code commenting (e.g. when closing ```<div>``` tags, demarcating sections of code, describing possibly ambiguous code choices) and use proper and consistent naming conventions.

*	RESTful. Implement some non-default (defaults are: add, create, update, destroy) RESTful routes to demonstrate your understanding of RESTful routing in Rails.


##GRADING
A project is considered satisfactory if it meets all core requirements. Anything extra is encouraged.
