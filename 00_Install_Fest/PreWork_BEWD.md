##BACK-END WEB DEVELOPMENT PRE-WORK (~5 – 7 HOURS):

Congratulations on joining us at General Assembly for the Back-End Web Development course! We are excited to have you, and are looking forward to working with you all soon!

In order to best prepare and ensure success in the course, we’ve gathered a list of resources that we’d like you to complete prior to the course start date ( September 24th, 2013). When you arrive on your first day, everyone will be up to speed and familiar with the necessary programming vocabulary needed to succeed in this course.

Learning Ruby on Rails, is not just about learning to code, it is also about exposure to other developer tools. So, in order to be most prepared we recommend going through the tutorials listed below. This should take you around 5– 7 hours to complete. 

Don’t feel like you have to become a master of everything before coming to class –we just want you to feel comfortable with some of the terms we will cover in class. Keep these resources as a reference during the course as they will come in handy.

Please reach out if you have any questions about anything or need help!

####Happy coding :)

###TUTORIALS:

#####For Windows Users

If you are using a Windows machine you will have to install [Gow](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow) before you can complete the the tutorials on command line basics. The terminal is how developers navigate their computers. Windows functions a little differently then what we will be using in class, however thanks to some brilliant devs we have tools such as Gow to make the transition easier. During lesson 0, instructors will help you install Ruby and Rails. Alternatively you can just read through the commands in Command Line Basics tutorial. You will practice lesson 1.

1. [Download](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/downloads) and Install Gow
2. Start the Command Prompt 
	1.	Click start
	2.	Type ```cmd``` and hit enter
	3. Voila the Command Prompt is open. 
3. You are ready to follow along in the terminal with the tutorials below. 




#####For Mac Users

You are good to go. Open your terminal by typing terminal in spotlight (magnifying glass at the top right corner of the screen).


####COMMAND LINE BASICS

Before we dive into programming, make sure you know are familiar with UNIX commands so you can use your computer like a developer. Complete one of the three tutorials below. 

-	[Unix / Linux Tutorial](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/) __only tutorial one through three__.
	
	Knowing how to use the command line (Terminal) is a critical skill for a developer, and we’ll be spending a lot of time here. This tutorial is all about practice. Work through the entire thing.

-	[Learn Command Line the Hard Way](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

	Another quick command line tutorial to solidify the basics and includes some good tips.

-	[Command Line Tutorial](http://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/)

	Another quick command line tutorial to solidify the basics and includes some good tips.

_**Most Important Takeaways **_:

1.	Create a new directory
2.	Remove/delete a file or directory
3.	Easily navigate to your home directory
4.	List all the contents of your home directory including hidden files
5.	Navigate using relative paths
6.	List all the files or directories that begin with “G”
7.	Use tab completion to view recently typed commands using the up arrow


####VERSION CONTROL

We will be using git to make it easy for you to collaborate, share and submit your code for review. Please watch the video and read the article about version control. Complete the Git tutorial and we will review in class.
