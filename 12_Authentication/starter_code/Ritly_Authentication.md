#Ritly

##Adding Authentication
####Time: 50 min

###Task Instructions

We are going to add authentication to Ritly using Devise.

Here is the functionality we need to add this lesson.

* Users must be logged in to Ritly in order to request a randomly generated code for their URL link.

*	Visitors to Ritly can go to ```localhost:3000/code``` and the application will redirect them to the  matched link in the database.

*	Visitors to Ritly can go to ```localhost:3000/code/preview``` and preview the matching URL link from the database.

Note: A visitor is anyone who comes to your site, they are not logged in users. A logged in user is also a visitor.
