##Review
###Rewsly 

*	Let's review Rewsly solution from last class.

---


##Authentication

![GitHub Sign Up Page](../../assets/rails/login_screen.png)

---


##Authentication

*	Use of a combination of username and password to validate user identity. (Obvious I know…)
*	Tracking a user's identity on our app through the __session__.

##Authentication
###What?

###Security

---



##Security
*	Can I view users' passwords in my app?
####NO!

---

##Security
###Storing Passwords
Bad practice to keep passwords in “clear text”*	Passwords can't be stored in plain text in your database.
If your database is compromised then passwords are compromised as well.
	*	Don't use the same password for all sites.	

---


##Security
###Hashing
Use one way hash

	```Digest::SHA1.hexdigest("secret")
	# => "e5e9fa1ba31ecd1ae84f75caaa474f3a663f05f4"
	```
---


##Security
###Adding Salt

Salt is random data that are used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password.


	```salt = "a761ce3a45d97e41840a788495e85a70d1bb3815"
		password = "secret"
		Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(salt+password)
		# =>"7963ca00e2e48ea80c615d037494de00a0964682"
	```
---


##Authentication
###Managing Users

*	When the user is authenticated we store the user_id in the __session__.

---


##Managing Users
###Session*	Session data commonly includes the browser user’s identity (name, login, shopping cart, etc.).*	To work, the web server must uniquely identify each browser’s particular HTTP requests while the session lasts.*	Commonly, web servers identify browsers by asking them to store a __cookie__.

---

##Managing Users
###Cookie

*	Used to store small bits of information (maximum size about 4k).
*	Cookies allow web servers to provide a temporary unique ID to a browser, to enable session management.	*	Browser storage is not secure.	*	Sensitive data (credit card numbers, etc.) should never be set in a cookie

##Authentication
###Gems
Creating authentication from scratch is a complex process (see resources for more info). However Developers have created Gems to make authentication "easy".
 
*	__Devise__
*	CanCan
*	Clearance
*	OmniAuth
*	DoorKeeper

##GEMS
###Free Code!
*	Gems are code really smart people built for you.

##Authentication 
###Devise GEM
[Devise Documentation](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
*	"Easy" to implement, integrate and customize.
*	Handles complex security, so you don't have to. 
*	Provides controller filters and view helpers (more on that in the code along).

##Devise 
###Recap
*	Adding Gems to the Gemfile

		gem 'devise', git: "https://github.com/plataformatec/devise.git", branch:  "rails4"
	
---


##Devise 
###Recap
*	Using Devise

		rails g devise:install # creates all the devise Controllers, views and initializers
		rails g devise user    # creates User model (or modifies it if it exists)
		rake db:migrate        # Let's Go!
	

---


##Devise 
###Recap
*	View helpers

		<%= user_is_logged_in? %>
		<%= current_user %>

---


##Authentication 
###Recap

##Devise 
###Recap
*	Blocking Access

		class ApplicationController ...
			before_action :authenticate_user!
		end
 
		class HomeController < ApplicationController
			skip_before_action :authenticate_user!
		end

---

##Devise 
###Recap
*	Changing the default Route names

		devise_for :users, :path_names => { sign_in: 'login', sign_out: 'logout' }
