###Homework


What's in your database?

We want students to start thinking about their models and inadvertently associations. This will help students better understand associations which we will cover next lesson.

*	Students will write a list of user information/data they would like their app to keep track of. 

(i.e. In my Rewsly app I want to store my users name, and email address. I also want to keep track of how many stories they created).
