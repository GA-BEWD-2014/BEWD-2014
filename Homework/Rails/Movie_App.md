#Movie App

Our client RetFlix wants BEWDiful students to develop an app for them. 

They want an application that allows visitors to:

*	View all movies in the database. 
*	Add a new movie to the database.
*	Edit a movie in the database. 
*	And search for a specific movie.


####Task Instructions

*	Create a new application called Movie_App.

*	Generate a Movies controller with an index action.

*	Set your root route to the index page.

*	Index.html.erb, welcomes users to the movie app. (Welcome to RetFlix! See our collection of movies below).

*	Generate a Movie model with title, description and year_released attributes.

*	Use the [seeds](../09_Models_Active_Record/exercises/seeds.rb) file to populate your database with movies.

*	Update your movie's index.html.erb so that it lists all movies in the database. (Google is your friend).

*	Rails console is also your friend. Use it to explore active record methods that help you accomplish the task.
