##BEWD FINAL PROJECT


###Milestone 1

Its project time! Now that you've been introduced to the world of Rails it's time to start thinking about your final project. 

To make sure you are not bitting off more than you can chew, we want  you to write a project proposal. Your proposal should include: 

*	Target audience
*	Description of functionality
*	If you plan on using an API add that to the proposal

Remember that this project should be a minimum viable product and something you can accomplish in 4-5 weeks.

Your instructional team will let you know if your project is feasible.
