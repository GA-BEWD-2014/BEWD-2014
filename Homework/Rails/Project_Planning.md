##What's in your database?

####Due: Lesson 13

We are going to continue to plan our final project. Note that this is not a milestone.

Think about your user. What information about your user would you like to store and keep track of? Wrtie a brief list.


__Rewsly Example__

*	I want Rewsly to store a users' email, first name, last name and phone number.
*	I want the app to keep track of all the stories a user created.
