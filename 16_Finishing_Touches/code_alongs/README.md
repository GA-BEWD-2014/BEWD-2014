*	Highlight the assets folder and explain its use. All students should be familiar with css, be sure to explain how css fits into a rails application.

*	Again, we want students to be able to utilize online documentation. Give students your how to read [Twitter Bootstrap Documentation](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap) Tips. The components page is particularly helpful. During the exercise, students will experiment with Bootstrap by reading and implementing Bootstrap components.
