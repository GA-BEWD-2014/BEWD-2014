If you are unfamiliar with Netflix, read about their services [here](https://signup.netflix.com/MediaCenter/HowNetflixWorks).

*	In groups students should think about how NetFlix' database tables. To make things easier, we've given students the tables they should work with. 

*	Allow students to brainstorm together about which tables should be related and how.

*	We provide a picture from one student in our solutions folder. Ask groups to present their findings. Together you should draw the associations on the white board.
