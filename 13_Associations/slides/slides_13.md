#BEWD - Associations

###Instructor Name

---


##Agenda

*	Discovering Associations
	*	Twitter Associations [Code-Along]
	*	Netflix Associations [Exercise]
*	Building Associations
	*	Rewsly Associations [Code-Along]

---

##Associations

* As the data we want to store in each table grows, sometimes we need more than just attributes
* For example, if we want to store the user who wrote a story, we could start by storing the user_name as an attribute on a story
* Then we'd add user_email, user_nickname, etcâ€¦ and it would quickly get messy

---


##Associations

* Eventually we realize, we actually want to store user data in a _users_ table
* Somehow, we'd need to link each story to its corresponding record in the users table
* This link is known as an _association_

---


##Associations
###Definition

Model associations are how models interact with each other. 

Adding associations will help us know which user posted which story. 

With associations its best to step away from the code and understand conceptually what is happening at a database level.

In the database, two tables can be linked together using a _foreign key_.

##Twitter Associations


---

##Associations
### Primary Keys

A unique key (field) that can uniquely identify each row in a table


---

##Associations
### Foreign Keys

Definition: A foreign key is a _column_ that is used to establish and enforce a link between data from two distinct tables.

---


##Associations
###Rails Active Record Associations

__belongs_to__

__has_many__

__has_many :through__

_has_one_

_has_one :through_

_has_and_belongs_to_many_


We will cover the bolded associations.

---

##Associations

User __has_many__ Tweets 

Tweet __belongs_to__ User

### Coding Associations

Now that we know how to identify associations, lets see how to add them in code.

##Rewsly

*	We need to add new features to Rewsly.
*	Stories must be associated to users.
*	Users can comment on stories.

---


## Homework

Project Milestone: 

*	List all models needed for your final project. 
*	Draw a diagram to show how they will be associated.

Due lesson 15.
