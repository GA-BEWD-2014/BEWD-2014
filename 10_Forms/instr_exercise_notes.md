Remember to share the [starter_code](starter_code/) at the beginning of class. Share completed code_demo files before lab time so students have an example to reference. 

#Movie App

Our client RetFlix wants BEWD students to develop an app for them. 

They want an application that allows visitors to:

*	View all movies in the database. 
*	Add a new movie to the database.
*	Edit a movie in the database. 
*	And search for a specific movie.

We will build a Rails app for RetFlix during lesson 9 & 10. Each lesson students will add more functionality to the app. 


##[Search Movies](starter_code/movie_app_part2.md) 

####Time: 15 min

| | |
|------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | forms, queries| 
| __Description__|Students add search functionality to the movies app. |
| __Activity Type__| Individual|

####Instructional Design Notes

*	Students use the Shirts Management app as a reference to add search functionality in the movies app. Make sure all students have a functioning version of shirts app, so they are able to complete this exercise.


##[Create & Edit Movie Forms](starter_code/movie_app_part2.md) (Lab Time)

####Time: Remaining time, due lesson 11

| | |
|------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | forms, safe params, validations| 
| __Description__|Students practice adding forms to an app. |
| __Activity Type__| Pair Programming|


####Instructional Design Notes

*	Review requirements with students before they begin. You may need to coach students on how to start.
*	Students aren't expected to complete this exercise in class. It should be turned in as homework lesson 11. 
*	Ideally we would like students to move all complex data queries to the model, however most will struggle with queries. The instructional team should walk the floor and use this time to help those that are struggling.
