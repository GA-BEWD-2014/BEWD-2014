####App Description

This application is a game center with two games, Secret Number and Rock Paper Scissors. Students will use the secret number code demo as a reference to add Rock Paper Scissors to the application.

__Secret Number__

*	Users click a number between 1 and 10. The controller validates the guess and renders the win or lose view.

__Rock Paper Scissors__

*	Students add this game during lab time. The controller picks a random throw and if it matches the user's throw it renders a winning message (otherwise, it shows a tie or loss message).


###Secret Number

####Key Teaching Points

*	Shows that logic in the controller can render a specific view

*	Demonstrate how views can link to a path and pass param to the controller.

*	Show how the app can be styled using CSS.

*	Demonstrate how you would add images to the application.

You should push the complete code prior to students adding Rock Paper Scissors.
