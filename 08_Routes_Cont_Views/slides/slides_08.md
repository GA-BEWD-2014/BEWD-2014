##The Dispatcher
###routes.rb

*	Located at config/routes.rb
*	Connects URLs to code
	* Used for mapping urls to your code
*	Current Routes: $ rake routes
	*	Rails 4: Can be seen at http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes

##Routes
###http verbs

GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE

![](../../assets/rails/http_verb.png)

---


##Http Verbs
###When GET is called.

*	Visiting a website
*	Clicking a link

---


##Model View Controller
###aka MVC

---


##MVC
###Routes to Controller

Controllers:

*	Render a View
*	Redirect to another view

---


##Controllers
###Controllers Are Objects!

*	Responsible for parsing user request

*	It can display some text to the browser, redirect to another path or send an error message.

*	Contains actions (aka functions)


---


##Controllers
###Methods

*	Recall: methods are "def blocks" in Ruby classes.
* Controllers are also classes, like any other.
* However, methods inside a controller are not like any other method; they are special (called Controller Actions)
* A Rails action gets invoked when a route matches to that controller/action combination
* Note: a private/protected method in a controller is NOT an action (you cannot hit that method via a URL). You can use private/protected methods to have helper methods inside a controller without being actions.

---


##Controllers
###Params

*	http://localhost:3000/games/secret_number/7
*	7 is a param, based on URL convention in the routes

---


##MVC
###Controller to Views

*	Views can be rendered directly by the controller
	*	Note: Not scalable when HTML file gets more complex

*	By default your controller renders the view named controller_name/action_name.html.erb


![Views Folder](../../assets/rails/views.png)

---

##Views
###html.erb

*	Can write html
*	Can write pure ruby.

		<% @games.each do |game| %>
			<%= game %>
		<% end %>

		<% 1 + 1 %> // won't show
		<%= 2 + 2 %> // will show!


![Views Folder](../../assets/rails/views.png)

---


##Views
###application.html.erb

*	All views are wrapped inside application.html.erb
	*	It loads the assets
	*	sets up the meta tags, titles etc...
	*	You can render no layout Or a different layout

---


##Views
###Assets Folder

* Keeps javascript files, stylesheets, and images

## Resources: Routes Controllers & Views

###Cheat Sheet

####Creating a new Controller and View

```bash
$ rails generate controller game index show
```
*	Creates game_controller.rb with action index and show
*	Adds entries to the routes.rb
*	Creates the view
	*	```app/views/games/index.html.erb```
	*	```app/views/games/show.html.erb``

####Adding Ruby To A View

 ```erb
 	<%  These are ruby tags %>
 ```

###Still Feel Lost?

At the end of this lesson you should be able to describe the flow of control in a Rails app.
