![screen shot 2](../../assets/rails/throw_choice.png)

*	Add the game Rock Paper Scissors to the "Games on Rails App".

*	Create a rock_paper_scissors_controller.rb similar to the secret number controller.

*	Use params[:id] as the user's throw number

*	Calculate the throw (rock, paper, scissors) based on the throw number (0, 1, 2)

*	Compare the 2! If the user's throw matches the apps throw, the user wins. If both are same, show a tie. Otherwise, show a loss message.

*	__Bonus__: Refactor the application so that it uses the real [rules of rock paper scissors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors).
