####Time: 30 min

| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ |rails app planning, user stories| 
| __Objective__ | Teach students how to approach an app from inception to construction.| 


####Key Teaching Points

By now students should have the knowledge to build a final project, however, they don't know how to start. This can be a major hurdle for some.

*	Provide your own methods of how you write stories. 
*	Students really value how you do things, so provide your own professional examples.

###Task Instructions

*	Ask for a volunteer. 
*	Use the volunteers final project as an example of how you would start an application.
*	Write 2 user stories for that project on the board. 
*	Wireframe two pages and demonstrate how you would user test.

During the exercise students will go through the same process for their own project. They will then user test their paper prototypes w/ 2 students.
