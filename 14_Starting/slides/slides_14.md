##How To Start
###Before you code


My proposal was accepted, now what…?

##How To Start
###Before you code

If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail - Benjamin Franklin

---


##How To Start
###Before you code

We are going to borrow some best practices from project managers and UX designers to help us plan our final project.

*	Planning before code will help prevent timely errors.

##User Stories
###Definition

	As a user, I want to take a photo of what I am eating and share it with the world so that everyone 	knows . - User Story for Instagram.


User stories are used with agile software development methodologies as the basis for defining the functions a business system must provide, and to facilitate requirements management. It captures the 'who', 'what' and 'why' of a requirement in a simple, concise way, often limited in detail by what can be hand-written on a small paper notecard. User stories are written by or for the business user as that user's primary way to influence the functionality of the system being developed.  - wikipedia.org

##User Stories
###How we will use them


*	We are going to write user stories to help define what functionality we need to build. 
*	We can also use them to determine what functionality we will build during this course and what we will build beyond BEWD.
*	In addition, we will create paper prototype for our web applications and diagram the database schema from our user stories.

##User Stories
###Basic Rules

This is the user story template: 

	“As a __<type of user>__, I want __<some goal>__ so that __<some reason>__.” 


Example User Story:

*	_“As a movie fan, I want to be able to add movies to my list which I can share with friends, so that they can order a movie from Amazon straight from my list.”_

##Wireframes and Paper Prototypes
###Definition

Wireframes are a key tool in communicating the content and layout of a web page. They are simple mock ups showcasing how the site will look. Some will use digital tools to create wireframes, others will draw them on paper.

They can be used by:

*	Project Managers to review plans with stakeholders
*	Programmers to develop functionality
*	Graphic designers to produce designs

##Wireframes and Paper Prototypes
###How we will use them

We are going to create simple prototypes using pen and paper. This is the fastest way to test your ideas.

---


##User Testing
###Definition


A simple method to evaluate a product by testing it on users. 

---



##User Testing
###How we will use it

During this class we will use our paper prototypes and test our ideas and layouts. This will help us define and scope functionality.

---



##User Testing
###How it Works

*	Your tester will use your paper prototype as if it were a real web application. 
*	Ask them to speak their thoughts aloud as they are testing. 
*	Take notes about what they find confusing, and make changes after you've tested all users.
*	The experts say you only have to test 5 people to find 95% of the problems with your design.
