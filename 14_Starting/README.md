##Lesson 14: Getting Started



###Learning Objectives

We want to give students tools to conceptualize and plan their final project. We hope that this will lead to everyone completing their project.

This lesson, students will:

*	Create user stories to help them define functionality.

*	Create wire frames of views based on user stories to better conceptualize what they want their app to accomplish.

*	Diagram database schemas.

Some instructors prefer to start with the database schema; however, we feel the order above is easier for students to conceptualize.

If this is not your "new project workflow", please teach students your method.
 

###Schedule

| Time        | Topic| GA ICLs| Comments |
| ------------- |:-------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| 30 min | How to Start | [user stories](instr_code_demo_notes.md) | In previous instances of this course, students struggled with where and how to start their final project, often leaving it to the last minute. Walk them through the getting started flow. Let students know at bigger organizations, this if often completed by a UX Designer or project manager.| 
| 20 min | Write Your User Stories | [Rapid Prototype Your App - User Stories](instr_exercise_notes.md) |  | 
| 30 min | Draw Wire Frames / Paper Prototypes | [Rapid Prototype Your App - Wire Frames](instr_exercise_notes.md)|  | 
| 45 min | User Testing | [Rapid Prototype Your App - User Testing](instr_exercise_notes.md) | Students test a few of their wireframes with 2 other students. | 
| 50 min | Drawing Database Schema | [Drawing The Database](instr_exercise_notes.md) | Continuation from last class, continue to draw database schema. | 



###Homework

Due Lesson 15: Milestone 2

*	At least 5 User Stories.
*	Diagram of database schema (models, attributes for those models, associations).

This milestone is a great way for you to identify major hurdles in a project before students begin to code. 


What's Due? 
-----------

Nothing.
